This repository contains the code, data processing pipeline, and experimental results for my tech stock forecasting project.

The study develops a two-tier optimization framework that integrates Genetic Algorithms (GA), Bayesian Optimization (BO), and NSGA-II for forecasting and trading strategy design on U.S. technology stocks (the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù).

üìå Project Overview

The project evaluates two model families:

	‚Ä¢	ARIMA‚ÄìGARCH: a stable, interpretable econometric benchmark with strong downside risk control.
	‚Ä¢	LSTM: a deep learning alternative that captures nonlinear dependencies but is more volatile.

A hybrid optimization pipeline is proposed:

	1.	Tier 1 ‚Äì Forecast-Oriented Optimization:

	‚Ä¢	GA for global hyperparameter search.
	‚Ä¢	BO for local refinement to minimize RMSE.

	2.	Tier 2 ‚Äì Trading-Oriented Optimization:
 
	‚Ä¢	NSGA-II jointly optimizes Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Drawdown.
	‚Ä¢	Knee-point selection identifies robust, deployable strategies.

Backtesting utilizes walk-forward validation (2010‚Äì2020) with retraining intervals of 10, 20, and 42 days, incorporating transaction costs and evaluating metrics such as RMSE, Sharpe Ratio, Maximum Drawdown, Turnover, and Cumulative Return.
